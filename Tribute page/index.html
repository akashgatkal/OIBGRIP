          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July
            2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
            president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
            came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

            <h4>Early life and Education</h4>
            <p>
                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family
                in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency
                and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and 
                imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father 
                owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now
                uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
                family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with 
                numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in
                coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. 
                The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to
                and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the
                opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the
                family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home.
                The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell 
                newspapers to add to the family's meager income. [19][20][21]
            </p>
            <p>
            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking
            student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially
            mathematics.[21] After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School,
            Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then 
            affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.[22] 
            He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.
            While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of 
            progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the
            next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him,
            "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23] He narrowly missed 
            achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight
            positions were available in the IAF.
